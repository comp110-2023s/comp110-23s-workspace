### Part 0. Reading Data from a Stored CSV File into Memory ###
###############################################################

# In this part of the exercise, you will implement 
# utility functions to read a CSV file from your computer's 
# hard-drive storage into your running program's (Jupyter kernel's) memory. 
# Once in memory, computations over the data set are very fast.

# By default, your CSV file is read in row-by-row. 
# Storing these rows as a list of "row" dictionaries is 
# one way of _representing_ tabular data.

###################################################
### 0.0) Implement the `read_csv_rows` Function ###
###################################################

# Complete the implementation of the `read_csv_rows` function 
# in `data_utils.py` and be sure to save your work when making 
# changes in that file _before_ re-evaluating the cell below to test it.

# Purpose: Read an entire CSV of data into a `list` of rows, 
# each row represented as `dict[str, str]`.

# * Function Name: `read_csv_rows`
# * Parameter: 
#     1. `str` path to CSV file
# * Return Type: `list[dict[str, str]]` 

# Implementation hint: refer back to the code you wrote in 
# lecture on 3/21 for reading a CSV file. 
# We give you the code for this function.

# There should be 294 rows and 29 columns read from the 
# `nc_durham_2015_march_21_to_26.csv` stops file. 
# Additionally, the column names should print below those stats.

### 0.1) `column_values` Function ###
#####################################

# Define and implement this function in `data_utils.py`.
#
# Purpose: Produce a `list[str]` of all values in a single `column`
# whose name is the second parameter.
#
# * Function Name: `column_values`
# * Parameters: 
#     1. `list[dict[str, str]]` - a list of rows representing a _table_
#     2. `str` - the name of the column (key) whose 
#           values are being selected
# * Return Type: `list[str]`
#
# Implementation hint: refer back to the code you wrote in 
# lecture on 3/21 for reading a CSV file. 
# Be sure to save your work before re-evaluating the cell below to test it. 
# With the data loaded in `nc_durham_2015_march_21_to_26.csv`, 
# there should be 294 values in the column. 
# The first five values of the `subject_age` column should be 
# 33, 25, 26, 24, 44.

################################        
### 0.2) `columnar` Function ###
################################

# Define and implement this function in `data_utils.py`.
#
# Purpose: _Transform_ a table represented as a list of rows 
# (e.g. `list[dict[str, str]]`) into one represented as 
# a dictionary of columns (e.g. `dict[str, list[str]]`).
#
# Why is this function useful? 
# Many types of analysis are much easier to perform column-wise.
#
# * Function Name: `columnar`
# * Parameter: `list[dict[str, str]]` 
#               - a "table" organized as a list of rows
# * Return Type: `dict[str, list[str]]` 
#               - a "table" organized as a dictionary of columns
#
# Implementation strategy: Establish an empty dictionary 
# to the your column-oriented table you are building up 
# to ultimately return. 
# Loop through each of the column names in the first row 
# of the parameter. 
# Get a list of each column's values via your `column_values` 
# function defined previously. Then, associate the column name 
# with the list of its values in the dictionary you established. 
# After looping through every column name, return the dictionary.

### Part 1. Selecting ("narrowing down") a Data Table ###
#########################################################

# When working with a data set, 
# it is useful to inspect the contents of the table 
# you are working with in order to both be convinced 
# your analysis is on the correct path and to know 
# what steps to take next with specific column names or values.

# In this part of the exercise, you will write some 
# useful utility functions to view the first `N` rows 
# of a column-based table (a function named `head`, 
# referring to the top rows of a table) and another 
# function `select` for producing a simpler data table 
# with only the subset of original columns you care about.

##### Displaying Tabular data with the `tabulate` 3rd Party Library ####

# Reading Python's `str` representations of tabular data, 
# in either representation strategy we used above 
# (list of rows vs. dict of cols), 
# is uncomprehensible for data wrangling. 
# This kind of problem is so common 
# a 3rd party library called `tabulate` is commonly used 
# to produce tables in Jupyter Notebooks. 
# This library was was included in your workspace's `requirements.txt`
# file at the beginning of the semester, 
# so you should already have it installed!

# For a quick demonstration of how the `tabulate` library works, 
# consider this simple demo below. 
# You should be able to evaluate it as is without any further changes
# and see the tabular representation appear.

from tabulate import tabulate

universities: dict[str, list[str, str]] = {"school": ["UNC", "NCSU", "Duke"], "mascot": ["Rameses", "Wolf", "A Literal Devil"], "founded": ["1789", "1887", "1838"]}

tabulate(universities, universities.keys(), "html")

############################
### 1.0) `head` Function ###
############################

# Define and implement this function in `data_utils.py`.

# Purpose: Produce a new column-based 
# (e.g. `dict[str, list[str]]`) table with only 
# the first `N` (a parameter) rows of data for each column.

# Why: Visualizing a table with hundreds, thousands, 
# or millions of rows in it is overwhelming. 
# You frequently want to just see the first few rows 
# of a table to get a sense you are on the correct path.

# * Function name: `head`
# * Parameters:
#     1. `dict[str, list[str]]` 
#       - a column-based table of data that _will not be mutated_
#     2. `int` 
#       - The number of "rows" to include in the resulting list
# * Return type: `dict[str, list[str]]`

# Implementation strategy: 

# 1. Establish an empty dictionary that will serve as 
#       the returned dictionary this function is building up. 
# 2. Loop through each of the columns in the first row 
#       of the table given as a parameter. 
#     1. Inside of the loop, establish an empty list to store 
#           each of the first N values in the column. 
#     2. Loop through the first N items of the table's column, 
#         1. Appending each item to the previously list 
#               established in step 2.1. 
#     3. Assign the produced list of column values to the 
#           dictionary established in step 1.
# 3. Return the dictionary.

# Once you have correctly implemented this function and saved your work, 
# you should be able to evaluate the cell below and see 
# the first five rows of the data table presented.

from exercises.ex08.data_utils import head

data_cols_head: dict[str, list[str]] = head(data_cols, 5)

if len(data_cols_head.keys()) != len(data_cols.keys()) or len(data_cols_head["subject_age"]) != 5:
    print("Complete your implementation of columnar in data_utils.py")
    print("Be sure to follow the guidelines above and save your work before re-evaluating!")

tabulate(data_cols_head, data_cols_head.keys(), "html")

##############################
### 1.1) `select` Function ###
##############################

# Define and implement this function in `data_utils.py`.

# Purpose: Produce a new column-based (e.g. `dict[str, list[str]]`) 
# table with only a specific subset of the original columns.

# Why: Many data tables will contain many columns that 
# are not related to the analysis you are trying to perform. 
# _Selecting_ only the columns you care about 
# makes it easier to focus your attention on the problem at hand.

# * Function Name: `select`
# * Parameters:
#     1. `dict[str, list[str]]` 
#           - a column-based table of data that _will not be mutated_
#     2. `list[str]` 
#           - the names of the columns to copy to the new, returned dictionary
# * Return type: `dict[str, list[str]]`

# Implementation strategy:

# 1. Establish an empty dictionary that will serve
#       as the returned dictionary this function is building up.
# 2. Loop through each of the columns _in the second 
#       parameter of the function_
#     1. Assign to the column key of the result dictionary the list 
#           of values stored in the input dictionary at the same column
# 3. Return the dictionary produced

# Once you have correctly implemented this function, 
# you can run the cell below to visualize the first 10 rows 
# of the table and should only see 2 columns: `subject_race`, 
# `subject_sex`.

from exercises.ex08.data_utils import select

selected_data: dict[str, list[str]] = select(data_cols, ["subject_race", "subject_sex"])

tabulate(head(selected_data, 10), selected_data.keys(), "html")

##############################
### 1.2) `concat` Function ###
##############################

# Define and implement this function in `data_utils.py`.

# Purpose: Produce a new column-based (e.g. `dict[str, list[str]]`) 
# table with two column-based tables combined.

# Why: You will often have data from different sources that 
# you may wish to combine in some way to perform an analysis

# * Function Name: `concat`
# * Parameters:
#     1. Two `dict[str, list[str]]` 
#        column-based tables of data that _will not be mutated_
# * Return type: `dict[str, list[str]]`

# Implementation strategy:

# 1. Establish an empty dictionary that will serve as the returned 
#       dictionary this function is building up.
# 2. Loop through each of the columns _in the first parameter 
#       of the function_
#     1. Assign to the column key of the result dictionary the list 
#           of values stored in the first parameter at the same column
# 3. Loop through each of the columns _in the second parameter 
#       of the function_
#     1. If the current column key is already in the result dictionary, 
#           add on the list of values stored in the second parameter 
#           at the same column 
#     2. Otherwise, just assign to the column key of the result 
#           dictionary the list of values stored in the second parameter 
#           at the same column
# 4. Return the dictionary produced

# Once you have correctly implemented this function, 
# you can run the cell below to see 5 stops from March 21st 
# and 5 stops from March 27th.


from exercises.ex08.data_utils import concat

additional_table: dict[str, list[str]] = columnar(read_csv_rows(f"{DATA_DIRECTORY}/nc_durham_2015_march_26.csv"))

combined = concat(data_cols_head, additional_table)

tabulate(head(combined, 10), combined.keys(), "html")

### Part 2. Simple Analysis ###
###############################

# Now that you have some functions to read, transform, 
# and select your data, let's perform some simple analysis! 
# With categorical data, _counting_ the frequency of values 
# is a common first step toward getting an overview of the column.

#############################
### 2.0) `count` Function ###
#############################

# Given a `list[str]`, this function will produce a `dict[str, int]` 
# where each key is a unique value in the given list and 
# each value associated is the _count_ of the number of times 
# that value appeared in the input list.

# * Function name: `count`
# * Parameter: `list[str]` - list of values to count the frequencies of
# * Return Type: `dict[str, int]` - a dictionary of the counts of 
#                                   each of the items in the input list

# Implementation strategy:

# 1. Establish an empty dictionary to store your built-up result in
# 2. Loop through each item in the input list
#     1. Check to see if that item has already been established 
#           as a key in your dictionary. 
#           Try the following boolean conditional: 
#           `if <item> in <dict>:` 
#           -- replacing `<item>` with the variable name
#           of the current value and `<dict>` with 
#           the name of your result dictionary.
#     2. If the item is found in the dict, that means 
#           there is already a key/value pair where the item is a key. 
#           Increase the value associated with that key by 1 (counting it!)
#     3. If the item is not found in the dict, 
#           that means this is the first time you are encountering 
#           the value and should assign an initial count of `1` 
#           to that key in the result dictionary.
# 3. Return the resulting dictionary.

# After you complete this function, you should see the following 
# counts with the included data set when you evaluate the code below:

# ~~~
# race_counts: {'black': 187, 'white': 64, 'hispanic': 38, 'asian/pacific islander': 3, 'other': 1, 'unknown': 1}
# sex_counts: {'female': 111, 'male': 183}
# ~~~

from exercises.ex08.data_utils import count

race_counts: dict[str, int] = count(selected_data["subject_race"])
print(f"race_counts: {race_counts}")

sex_counts: dict[str, int] = count(selected_data["subject_sex"])
print(f"sex_counts: {sex_counts}")
